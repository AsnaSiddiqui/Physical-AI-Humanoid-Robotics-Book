# URDF for Humanoid Robot Description

This chapter covers the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) and its extension Xacro, which are used to describe robot models in ROS. For humanoid robots, accurate descriptions are crucial for simulation and control.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure of URDF files
- Learn to create URDF descriptions for humanoid robots
- Use Xacro to simplify complex URDF files
- Validate URDF models in ROS 2

## What is URDF?

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is an XML format used to describe robot models in ROS. It contains information about the robot's physical properties, including links, joints, materials, and visual/inertial properties.
