# ROS 2 Programming with Python (rclpy)

This chapter covers programming ROS 2 nodes using Python and the rclpy library. Python is a popular choice for robotics development due to its simplicity and extensive libraries.

## Learning Objectives

- Set up a Python environment for ROS 2 development
- Create publishers and subscribers using rclpy
- Implement services and clients in Python
- Work with ROS 2 messages and custom message types

## Introduction to rclpy

rclpy is the Python client library for ROS 2. It provides a Python API for developing ROS 2 nodes, allowing you to create publishers, subscribers, services, and actions using Python.
